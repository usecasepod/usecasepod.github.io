We're super excited to have launched this website for Use Case, but Clinton and I have a bigger vision for what this will be. We're hoping that in the coming months this will become a jumping off point for us to build a community around our little show. We started this project for the topics that *we* find interesting, but as it grows we want to find out more about our listeners and what **you** want.

So if you have a question or correction, leave a comment on the Episode's page! Want to know more about us? Ask a question in the comments section below! 

We also take recommendations on [twitter](https://twitter.com/usecasepod) and at [usecasepod@gmail.com](mailto:usecasepod@gmail.com)!
