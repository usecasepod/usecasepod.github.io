On this not so spooky episode, [Clinton](https://twitter.com/clintonjwalker) does his best sports ball announcer voice and [Austin](https://twitter.com/austinwebre) reflects on a year's worth of episodes. They also wade into the debate over the usefullness of design patterns and whether modern languages have made them obsolete.
