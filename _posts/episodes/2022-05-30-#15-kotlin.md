[Clinton](https://twitter.com/clintonjwalker) and [Austin](https://twitter.com/austinwebre) finally talk about Clinton's favorite company (Jetbrains) and how they have applied themselves to language design. They take an in-depth look at how the company has attempted to make Java irrelevant with Kotlin, not just with the language itself but by fostering a community and integrating the language into their suite of developer tools.
