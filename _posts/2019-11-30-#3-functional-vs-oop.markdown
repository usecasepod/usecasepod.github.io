[Clinton](https://twitter.com/clintonjwalker) and [Austin](https://twitter.com/austinwebre) talk about what Functional Programming is, how it compares to OOP and how Functional paradigms have made their way into Object Oriented languages. This month's Git Trendy also features special guest. Lily, a feisty Mini Schnauzer has something to say about DevOps - we're just not quite sure what.
