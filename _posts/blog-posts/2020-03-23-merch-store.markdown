First off, we hope that everyone is managing to stay safe and sane amidst this pandemic. Our whole lives seem to have changed drastically over a span of just a few days and I know it can feel like a lot to take in. In times like these, its more important than ever to invest in community, so feel free to reach out to us [@usecasepod](https://twitter.com/usecasepod) on Twitter and [usecasepod@gmail.com](mailto:usecasepod@gmail.com) or by commenting below.

## Merch Store
On a more exciting note, we launched a merch store this week! We have an array of products available on our [Redbubble store](https://rdbl.co/2QD97YJ)! Our current product line includes T-shirts (in many styles), hoodies, sweatshirts, phone cases, and mugs. We've tried to keep cost to a minimum so please check out some of the items, we think you'll find the prices *very* reasonable. Clinton and I each got a shirt to try out and we couldn't be more excited by the results, which you can find a picture of [here](https://twitter.com/usecasepod/status/1241492587107831811?s=20) (along with a certain famous podcasting canine). Check out the store, support us, and tell your friends (unless they aren't developers... then maybe don't spend so much talking about this weird podcast).

## The Future of Use Case
Though this podcasst is not the most important thing in the world, we do want to reassure everyone that we plan to keep this podcast coming every month. We recognize that this disease may require even more restrictive measures to stop the spread, but so long as we have an internet connection and the requisite free time - coincidentally I have **more** free time lately - we will continue to release episodes in some form. So keep listening, wash your hands, and try to keep your sanity - as Clinton would say, **THE POWER IS YOURS**.
